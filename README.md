# Go By Example
Example code from the [online course](https://gobyexample.com) that demonstrate the features of the Go language. This is a great introduction or refresher of Golang and aside from the "Tour of Go", it's one of the best introductions. Time permitting, I will add comments within the code to better describe what each is doing, or just visit the course and read the annotations.

# Usage
1. Clone repo
2. cd `{folder}`
3. `go run {app}.go`
